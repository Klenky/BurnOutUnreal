# Burnout

## Developed with Unreal Engine 4




### BURNOUT 2.0 MECHANICS DOCUMENT:


-The Chemist 
	The Chemist is the player character. This character, a chemist (obviously), stayed up for three days and accidentally set themselves on fire. Bummer.

As the Chemist, the player must move and jump around the environment while avoiding any obstacles, with the ultimate goal being to reach the shower so you can extinguish the fire.


Here’s the chemist while not on fire:

-Barrel
	The barrel functions as an obstacle for the player. It rolls across the floor or conveyer belt, and explodes upon coming into contact with the player. This explosion will instantly kill the player.

-Oil Slick 
	Oil Slicks are like conveyor belts that only push the player forward while fire spawns behind them as they move across the oil. If the fire catches up to the player, it’s game over!

-Conveyor Belt
	Conveyor Belts work similarly to oil slicks, but without the fire and limited movement. You can move either left or right, but if you move against the conveyor belt’s natural direction, you’ll be met with some resistance.

-Platforms/Floor
	Platforms act as the floor for the player character. The player can walk across them and jump on them. They appear to be made out of concrete.

-Walls
	Walls are wall-y. If you hit one, you stop moving. Usually.

-Crate

Crates are obstacles that the player must jump over or push. Luckily, they’re not full of explosive materials, so they won’t explode when you collide with them.

-Fire
	Fire is spawned when you step on an oil slick. Fire is deadly, and will kill the player instantly upon collision.

-Hidden Door 
	Hidden doors are walls that seem out-of-place in the natural environment. When the player throws a TNT box at the hidden wall, it explodes- revealing a new door!

-TNT boxes
	TNT boxes are an item that can be used by the player to open hidden doors. The player picks up the item when they walk over it and can throw it by pressing “E.” If the TNT collides with a hidden door, it explodes and a new path is revealed! If it collides with fire, it just explodes.

-Elevator
	Elevators are platforms that move vertically up and down. When they player steps on one, it moves up or down in a predetermined direction.
